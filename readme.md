Hierarchy is a project for a general tree data structure. 

Under development actually, there is no optminisation or a specific data behind it. At least, it aims to provide flexible way shortly to server as a storage for to embed any data in the treeNode. 

As a result, no range support will be support explicitly

Note that this module suffer an important encapsulation issue on the tree module, but main reason is that use interface definition is still in definition yet, when done, tree can't be modified except calling explicitly a tree method
